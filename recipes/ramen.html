    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Oven Roasted Crispy Pork Belly that's crisped up just before adding to the soup. The broth is delicate with hints of ginger, soy sauce and sesame oil and soft cooked eggs. For flavor, texture, and to make the soup more nutritious, I add some baby bok choy and garnish with fresh cilantro, green onions and Thai basil. Then a bit of sriracha for kick! It's the perfect bowl of ramen!</p>

    <ul> Ingredients - for 4 people
      <li>6 Cups Chicken Stock</li>
      <li>500g Pork Belly</li>
      <li>1 packet of Egg Noodles</li>
      <li>2 heads baby bok choy - sliced</li>
      <li>1 tsp fresh grated ginger</li>
      <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 tsp toasted sesame oil</li>
      <li>4 large eggs</li>
      <li>Sriracha</li>
      <li>green onions</li>
      <li>fresh coriander</li>
      <li>Basil - chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>Method
      <li>Bring chicken stock to boil.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, slice Oven Roasted Crispy Pork Belly (or other cooked pork belly) into ⅛-inch lengthwise slices. Place in a skillet over medium heat and fry until edges are crisp, about 5 minutes. Remove from skillet to a paper towel to drain.</li>
      <li>Add ramen noodles to boiling broth and cook one minute (longer if you're using dried ramen noodles). After one minute add bok choy and ginger; bring to boil and cook one minute more. Remove from heat and stir in soy sauce and sesame oil. </li>
      <li>Divide ramen between 4 bowls. Top each with two egg halves, ¼ of pork belly and desired amounts of sriracha, green onions, cilantro and basil. Serve.</li>
    </ol>
